          <p>Resultados Digitais is a Brazilian company founded in 2011 that specializes in digital marketing and sales automation. It provides a platform for managing online marketing, generating leads, and optimizing sales processes through tools for inbound marketing, email marketing, social media management, CRM, and analytics, primarily targeting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
          <p>My time at the company can be divided into three key phases: first, as a solo marketing designer, where I managed all digital assets for the marketing team; second, as a design leader, responsible for establishing and leading the internal Creative Services team to scale design operations as the company expanded; and third, as a DesignOps professional, marking a technical career shift to support more strategic projects within the organization.</p>

            <p>The Inbound Marketing strategy centered on digital assets like landing pages, eBooks, and webinars, along with in-person events such as RD Summit—the largest marketing event in Brazil—and RD on the Road, a regional traveling event. We created all supporting materials for these initiatives, including event branding, signage, and promotional content, ensuring consistency and a cohesive experience across all channels.</p>

          <p>As a Design Ops, my role was to streamline processes, tools, and workflows to ensure the design team operated efficiently and delivered consistent results. I managed resources, facilitated collaboration across departments, ensured consistency across marketing assets, and tracked metrics to optimize performance and scalability while aligning design efforts with broader business goals and supporting the rebranding project.
